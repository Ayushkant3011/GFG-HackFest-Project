    <h1>Common Problems in Fruit Plants</h1>

    <p>Fruit plants may face various challenges that can affect their health and productivity. Here are some common problems:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pests:</strong> Insects and other pests can damage leaves, flowers, and fruits. Common pests include aphids, mites, and fruit flies.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Diseases:</strong> Fungal, bacterial, and viral diseases can impact fruit plants. Examples include powdery mildew, bacterial spot, and citrus canker.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Nutrient Deficiency:</strong> Lack of essential nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, or potassium, can lead to stunted growth and poor fruit development.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Water Stress:</strong> Both overwatering and underwatering can cause stress. It may lead to wilting, leaf drop, and a decline in overall plant health.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Environmental Stress:</strong> Extreme temperatures, frost, and unfavorable weather conditions can negatively affect fruit plants.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Improper Pruning:</strong> Incorrect pruning practices may result in reduced fruit production and increased vulnerability to diseases.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Soil Issues:</strong> Poor soil drainage, compaction, or acidity can impact root health and nutrient uptake.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Weed Competition:</strong> Weeds competing for nutrients and sunlight can hinder the growth of fruit plants.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Improper Pollination:</strong> Insufficient pollination can lead to a decrease in fruit set. Some plants may require assistance from pollinators.</li><br>
    </ul>
