        <li><strong>Leaves:</strong> Typically broad, green, and play a crucial role in photosynthesis.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Flowers:</strong> Often have colorful petals and are responsible for pollination.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Fruits:</strong> Develop after successful pollination, containing seeds for reproduction.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Roots:</strong> Provide stability and absorb water and nutrients from the soil.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Stems:</strong> Support the plant structure and transport water, nutrients, and sugars.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Growth Habit:</strong> Some plants have a bushy growth habit, while others may be tall and tree-like.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Seasonal Changes:</strong> Fruit plants may go through seasonal changes, including flowering and fruiting seasons.</li><br>
