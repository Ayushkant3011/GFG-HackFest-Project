    <h1>Banyan Tree</h1>

    <p>
        The banyan tree is a fascinating and unique species known for its vast and spreading canopy. Belonging to the fig family (Ficus), banyan trees are characterized by their aerial prop roots that descend from the branches to the ground, forming additional trunks. These roots not only provide support but also contribute to the tree's distinctive appearance.

        Banyan trees are commonly found in tropical regions and are revered in many cultures for their symbolism and religious significance. The intricate network of roots and branches creates a natural shelter, making the banyan tree a symbol of harmony and interconnectedness with nature.
